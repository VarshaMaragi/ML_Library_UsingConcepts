# ML_Library_UsingConcepts
ML Library written in C++ using Concepts with implementation of basic algorithms 

After having cloned the LibML repository, you can build and run the test code by entering the test directory
and running make test.
This will produce an executable named Projectmain which can be run to show how LibML functions.
